## Anonymous messaging using mix networks

This is an implementation of a private communications system based on
Ania Piotrowska's PhD research. It implements a 
[Loopix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00536) mixnet as well as the 
[Sphinx](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf) packet format.
